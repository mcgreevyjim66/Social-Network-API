# Social Network API

## Description

This project will build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. It will use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. It will also use a JavaScript date library moment to format timestamps.

## User Story
